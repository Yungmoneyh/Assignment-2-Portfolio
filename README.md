How to View:

In order to view the page you have to open the website.html code and open to link server and it'll open the browser.

Once you go onto any of the pages you have to click any one of the other options (Home, About me, Contact, Projects) at the top of the page to go to any of the other pages.

In the code you can also resize the window to see how it looks on different devices such as mobile devices (smaller device), tablets (medium size device) and desktop (bigger device).

All of the code was written by me as I have learned from the tutorials and lectures aswell as I like to learn on my free time.

I only used the lecture notes provided and taught to me from class to help me complete this code. I didn't use any outside source for any of these codes. 

I really enjoyed doing this assignment and it also helped dexpand my knowledge on Java even more.
