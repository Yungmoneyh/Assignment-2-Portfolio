    <!-- Intro paragraph -->
    <p class="lead mb-4">
      Hello! I’m <strong class="text-info">Hirosan Ravichandran</strong>, 
      a <strong>Networking and IT Security</strong> student at 
      <strong>Ontario Tech University</strong>, passionate about 
      securing systems, analyzing threats, and building stronger digital defenses.
    </p>

    <!-- Personal background paragraph -->
    <p class="mb-4">
      I moved to <strong>Canada</strong> at the age of four and my journey since has been filled with 
      tons of different <strong>challenges</strong>, <strong>losses</strong> and <strong>growth</strong>. 
      Coming from a humble start, I had to adapt, learn as fast as I can and work hard to be where I am today. 
      Every single hard situation I was in I managed to get through it and that same drive continues to push me 
      forward in everything I do. Since then I always remembered to <strong>live on my own vision</strong> and 
      <strong>stay determined</strong> and I even have them <strong>tatted on my skin</strong> as a reminder 
      of the struggles I’ve been through.
    </p>

    <!-- How passion for technology started -->
    <p class="mb-4">
      My passion for technology started early at just <strong>14 years old</strong>, 
      I was designing and managing <strong>Shopify websites</strong>, and at one point I decided to 
      run my own business. Doing this introduced me to how systems work behind the scenes and eventually, 
      how to protect them. As time went by, my curiosity about <strong>cryptocurrency</strong>, 
      <strong>distributed systems</strong>, and the <strong>markets</strong> expanded my interest in 
      digital security and network protection.
    </p>

    <!-- Technical experience paragraph -->
    <p class="mb-4">
      Through school projects and hands-on labs, I’ve built a strong foundation in 
      <strong>network configuration</strong> and <strong>cybersecurity tools</strong>. 
      I’ve used <strong>Cisco Packet Tracer</strong> to design and troubleshoot LANs, 
      <strong>Wireshark</strong> to analyze network traffic, and simulated 
      <strong>spoofing and intrusion attacks</strong> in controlled environments such as 
      <strong>Kali Linux</strong>. These experiences helped me gain insights into both 
      <strong>offensive and defensive security strategies</strong>.
    </p>

    <!-- Personal interests and goals paragraph -->
    <p class="mb-4">
      Beyond technology, I’ve <strong>run events</strong> and operated a 
      <strong>360 photo booth business</strong>, where I learned the value of 
      <strong>leadership</strong>, <strong>creativity</strong>, and <strong>resilience</strong>. 
      Outside of work and school, I enjoy <strong>playing basketball</strong>, 
      <strong>rapping</strong>, and <strong>exploring new restaurants</strong> with family and friends. 
      My goal is to become a <strong>cybersecurity professional</strong> who not only protects systems 
      but also inspires others through <strong>determination</strong>, 
      <strong>innovation</strong>, and an <strong>unshakable passion for learning</strong>.
