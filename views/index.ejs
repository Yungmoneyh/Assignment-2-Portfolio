    Hi — I'm <strong>Hirosan Ravichandran</strong>, a Networking & IT Security student at 
    <strong>Ontario Tech University</strong>. I focus on practical network labs,
    cyber labs, and defensive security tools. I enjoy solving networking problems and 
    I’m excited to learn more! This field is one of the fastest growing 
    industries internationally and I am determined to keep improving. Below I have a list 
    of some projects I have completed — and you can also get to know a little more 
    about me and my story.
